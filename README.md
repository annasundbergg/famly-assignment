# Nursery Web Application ðŸŒ»

## Overview

This web application is created to help nurseries manage the check-in and check-out process of children. When parents arrive to drop their children off, they select a pick-up time and check in the child, and check them out when picking them up. The application integrates with an API to fetch data about registered children.

## Features

- **API Integration:** Fetch data about registered children from an API using an access token.
- **Check-in/Check-out:** Display lists of children, depending on if they are currently checked in or checked out.
- **Check-in Process:**
  - If a child is not checked in, parents can select a pick-up time.
  - Press the "Check In" button to register the child as checked in.
- **Check-out Process:**
  - When picking up the child, press the "Check Out" button to mark the child as checked out.
